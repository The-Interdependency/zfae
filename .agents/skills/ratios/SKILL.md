The canonical seal is `The-Interdependency/a0`'s compact positional `N:M C:D I:O` annotation (code:comment · consumed:declared · fan-in:fan-out), computed by a0's `scripts/annotate.py`; the named `loc_comments=… imports_exports=… calls_definitions=…` line is a portable, per-file adaptation for standalone libraries, verified by the stdlib `ratios_check.py` (drift/misplacement failures, visible gaps).

# ratios — Module composition ratios on msdmd

`ratios` is an application of [msdmd](../msdmd/SKILL.md). The foundational
skill defines the comment-block convention, the universal parser, and the
gap-reporting requirement; this skill applies the convention to a module's
own composition ratios and defines the executor contract.

Read `msdmd/SKILL.md` first if you haven't — the parser contract and the
visibility rules below are inherited from there and not redefined.

A ratio is a fact an executable/source module owns about its own shape. Like a contract, it
belongs in the file it describes, not in a side report that can drift out
of sync. Unlike a contract, it is not asserted by a human — it is
*recomputed from the source*, so a recorded ratio that no longer matches
the file is a build failure, not a stale comment nobody noticed.

## The canonical seal: a0's `N:M C:D I:O`

`The-Interdependency/a0` is the **canonical origin** of the ratios seal — the
convention every other form adapts, not the other way round. a0 stamps three
composition metrics on the first and last line of every Python / TypeScript
file, written and verified by its own `scripts/annotate.py`:

```text
# N:M C:D I:O        (Python)
// N:M C:D I:O       (TypeScript / TSX)
```

| pair | meaning | how computed |
|---|---|---|
| `N:M` | code lines : comment+docstring lines (internal density; `N` budget ≤ 400) | per-file |
| `C:D` | consumed : declared (surface utility — `D` = declared `# DOC` endpoints / exported symbols; `C` = those actually consumed elsewhere in the repo) | repo-wide index |
| `I:O` | fan-in : fan-out (graph position — `I` = files importing this one; `O` = project-internal modules it imports) | repo-wide index |

`C:D` and `I:O` are **not single-file computable**: they need the inverted
import/usage index built across the whole repo. a0's `scripts/annotate.py` is
the in-repo canonical computer.

### Portable computer: `ratios/annotate_index.py`

A shared, stdlib port of that index ships here as `ratios/annotate_index.py`, so
the canonical seal can be recomputed or stamped in **any** repo, not just a0:

```bash
python ratios/annotate_index.py --root .            # report drift/misplacement
python ratios/annotate_index.py --root . --write    # stamp the N:M C:D I:O seal
python ratios/annotate_index.py --root . --check    # CI gate (non-zero on drift)
```

It reproduces a0's metric definitions exactly (`build_index` → per-file
`{code, comment, consumed, declared, fan_in, fan_out}`; `seal_line` renders the
compact line). The one a0-specific input — the consumer dirs scanned for `C`
(default `client/src`, `server`) — is a `consumer_dirs=` parameter. Honest
caveat carried in the module docstring: `C:D` is route/surface-oriented, so a
pure library with no `# DOC endpoint:` routes and no TS exports reads
`C:D = 0:0` (correct, not a gap), and fan-in/out follow a0's relative-import
stem graph (absolute-only imports are not counted).

## The portable named form (per-file adaptation)

The verbose `loc_comments=… imports_exports=… calls_definitions=…` line below is
a **portable, per-file adaptation** of the canon for standalone libraries that
lack a0's app structure (no `client/src` / `server` to measure "consumed"
against, no meaningful repo-wide fan-in). Its three ids are single-file
computable, so the stdlib `ratios_check.py` verifies them with no repo index.
`loc_comments` is exactly a0's `N:M`; `imports_exports` and `calls_definitions`
are per-file stand-ins for the surface/graph intent of `C:D` and `I:O`. Repos
already stamped in this form (skill-lib, aimmh, edcmbone, pcna, pcta, ptca,
pcea) remain valid and are **not** required to reconvert.

Both forms keep one seal discipline: a single line on the file's first and last
non-blank line, with nothing above it.

### The single line, and the first/last rule

RATIOS is the one msdmd declaration that is **not a fenced block**. It applies
to executable/source files with a language comment marker (`#`, `//`, or `--`),
not to JSON, Markdown, or other data/documentation files. In covered source
files it is a single comment line carrying all three ratios, placed on the
file's **literal first line and its last non-blank line**:

```python
# ratios: loc_comments=128:49 imports_exports=4:7 calls_definitions=51:10
"""The module body lives between the two ratio lines."""
...
# ratios: loc_comments=128:49 imports_exports=4:7 calls_definitions=51:10
```

The form is:

```text
<marker> ratios: loc_comments=N:M imports_exports=N:M calls_definitions=N:M
```

- `<marker>` is the language-idiomatic comment marker (`#`, `//`, `--`) for executable/source files only; JSON and Markdown are intentionally not covered by this rule.
- The three ids are fixed: `loc_comments`, `imports_exports`,
  `calls_definitions`. Each carries an `A:B` value, or `hmmm` if the ratio is
  declared-but-not-yet-resolved.
- The same line opens and closes the file. The file is a self-measuring
  object; its boundary lines carry the measurement, opening and closing.
- Scope: executable source files only. `json` and `.md` files are out of
  scope for first/last-line RATIOS bookends.

There is no fenced `# === RATIOS === … # === END RATIOS ===` block. An earlier
draft of this skill described one; that was wrong. Tooling reads the single
line from both ends and verifies they agree.

## Field requirements

The required ratio ids are exactly `loc_comments`, `imports_exports`, and
`calls_definitions`. Each covered executable/source file records all three ids
on both boundary lines. Unknown ratio values are written `hmmm`; unknown ratio
ids stay unresolved until a matching computer is defined.

## How it is parsed

The reader lives in the msdmd universal parser as a sanctioned extension, not
a fork (`msdmd/parsers/universal.py`):

```python
from msdmd.parsers.universal import parse_ratios, ratios_placement, RATIO_IDS

parse_ratios(text, marker)      # -> [{"id": "loc_comments", "value": "128:49"}, ...]
ratios_placement(text, marker)  # -> (first_line_ok, last_non_blank_line_ok)
```

`parse_ratios` returns one flat `{"id", "value"}` dict per (declaration line ×
ratio token), so the drift gate can verify every occurrence. It interprets no
semantics — that is the runner's job. A file with no `ratios:` line yields `[]`
and surfaces as a coverage gap.

## The registry and the verify contract

A ratio is *verified* when its `id` maps to a computer in the runner's
registry. A computer is a pure function `file_text -> "A:B"`. The runner:

- recomputes the ratio from the source, **excluding every `ratios:` line**
  (and any tolerated legacy fence) so a measuring line never inflates its own
  measurement;
- compares the recomputed value to the recorded value;
- on mismatch, emits a **drift** error and exits non-zero;
- on a declaration that is not on both the first and last line, emits a
  **misplaced** error and exits non-zero;
- on `value: hmmm`, reports a living continuation (pending), never a failure —
  the transition out of `hmmm` is the owner's decision;
- on an id with no registered computer, reports it as recorded-but-
  unverifiable (informational), so unknown ratios stay visible rather than
  silently trusted.

Covered source files with no `ratios:` line surface as coverage gaps, exactly
as in the build checker. JSON, Markdown, and other files with no supported
source comment marker are skipped rather than reported as gaps. The gap list is
informational unless `--strict`.

## The three ratios

### 1. `loc_comments` — lines of code to lines commented

`loc_comments` is `lines_of_code : lines_commented`.

- **N (lines of code)**: physical lines carrying a code token — not blank,
  not a pure comment, not a docstring-only line.
- **M (lines commented)**: strict `#`-comment lines plus docstring lines
  (`"""` / `'''` blocks).
- **self-exclusion**: every `ratios:` line is excluded from both counts.

Diagnostic signal: a ratio that drifts toward very high N:M (many code
lines, few comments) is approaching a code budget with low documentation
coverage. A ratio drifting toward very low N:M may indicate grounding load —
overhead accumulating faster than implementation.

---

### 2. `imports_exports` — import statements to public exports

`imports_exports` is `import_count : export_count`.

- **import_count**: lines whose stripped content matches
  `^(import |from \S+ import)`. Continuation lines of a multi-line import
  are not counted separately — only the opening `import` / `from` line.
- **export_count**: count of top-level `def` and `class` declarations
  whose names carry no leading underscore (public surface), **plus 1** if
  `__all__` appears anywhere in the file.
- **self-exclusion**: `ratios:` lines excluded from both counts.

Diagnostic signal: a high imports:exports ratio (many imports, few public
symbols) suggests the module is a consumer or orchestrator — low surface,
high dependency. A low ratio suggests a leaf module or utility layer.

---

### 3. `calls_definitions` — call sites to definitions

`calls_definitions` is `call_count : definition_count`.

- **definition_count**: top-level `def` and `class` lines plus one level of
  method nesting beneath a class. Closures nested inside another `def` do not
  count.
- **call_count**: non-definition, non-comment, non-blank, non-string lines
  containing at least one call expression matching `\w+\(`. Each physical
  line counts once regardless of how many calls it contains.
- **self-exclusion**: `ratios:` lines excluded from both counts.

Diagnostic signal: a very high calls:definitions ratio suggests a dense
orchestration file — close coupling. A low ratio suggests mostly definitions
with few call sites — a library or schema module.

---

## The runner

The reference runner ships here as `ratios_check.py` (pure stdlib; it reuses
`parse_ratios` from the msdmd universal parser):

```bash
# verify one file's recorded ratios against its source
python ratios_check.py path/to/module.py

# walk a tree, verifying executable/source files and listing source gaps
python ratios_check.py --root .

# strict: files with no ratios: line also fail (CI gate)
python ratios_check.py --root . --strict
```

Exit codes: `0` all recorded ratios match and are correctly placed (gaps
allowed unless `--strict`); `1` a ratio drifted from source, a declaration was
misplaced, or — under `--strict` — a coverage gap.

## a0 is the canon, not a dialect

The compact `N:M C:D I:O` form under **The canonical seal** above is the origin
the named form adapts — not a dialect *of* it. The mapping back to the portable
ids: `N:M` ≡ `loc_comments` (identical); `C:D` (consumed:declared) and `I:O`
(fan-in:fan-out) are the repo-wide surface/graph measures that `imports_exports`
and `calls_definitions` only approximate per-file.

Do **not** teach the canonical `parse_ratios` reader to parse a0's compact line:
a0's `scripts/annotate.py` owns reading and verifying the canonical seal (its
`C:D` / `I:O` need the repo-wide index `parse_ratios` deliberately does not
build). Pointing `ratios_check.py` at a0 and seeing the compact lines reported
as gaps is expected, not a bug.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing RATIOS as a fenced `# === RATIOS === … # === END RATIOS ===` block.
  It is a single `ratios:` line; the block form was a mistake.
- Recording a ratio by hand instead of recomputing it. The point is that the
  file measures itself; a hand-typed value is a contract that drifts.
- Placing the line anywhere but the file's first and last line. The first/last
  placement is the convention; a mid-file `ratios:` line defeats the
  at-a-glance reading and fails the placement gate.
- Counting a `ratios:` line in its own ratio. Always self-exclude.
- Inventing ratio ids whose computer does not exist and recording a number
  for them. If there's no computer, the value cannot be verified — record
  `hmmm` until a computer is registered.
- Introducing a parser dialect for ratios. The single-line reader is an msdmd
  extension (`parse_ratios`); if richer syntax is needed, extend msdmd, do
  not fork it.

## Completion criteria

A run is complete when every covered executable/source file carries a correctly placed `ratios:`
line on its first and last line, the registry's three computers
(`loc_comments`, `imports_exports`, `calls_definitions`) recompute each
recorded value with no drift, and any unresolved ratio is recorded as `hmmm`
rather than guessed.

hmmm
- the reference computers implement the Python counting rules; language-aware
  computers for TypeScript/other markers are a documented extension point, not
  yet implemented in `ratios_check.py`
- whether ratios verification joins CI beside the other msdmd checks
- calls_definitions: whether lambda assignments count as definitions
- imports_exports: whether re-exported names from `__init__.py` aggregate
  files count once or per-name
